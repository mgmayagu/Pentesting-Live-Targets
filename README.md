# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

### Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

[x] **SQL Injection** : Most of the data input received by these websites is
  being sanitized properly. However, one of the three sites has one place where
  the input is not being sanitized before being used in an SQL query. Determine
  which color has the vulnerability.

  * [x] GIF Walkthrough:  ![alt text](/blue1.gif)

  * [x]  The Attacker injects the following sql command instead of the proper Salesperson's ID Number.
  ```html
  %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27
  ```
  * [x]  This causes the Database command to wait for 10 seconds while quering the data.
  
  
### Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

[x] **Session Hijacking/Fixation** : Two of the three websites expire their active sessions and require users to re-login every 30 minutes. That is probably too aggressive for the real world, but it is better than the third site which allows sessions to be a year old, and never regenerates the session ID, even when the user agent string changes. This makes it vulnerable to both session hijacking and session fixation attacks.
  
  * [x] GIF Walkthrough:  ![alt text](/blue2.gif)

  * [x] The user can log in without a username or password by setting the current session ID to an old session ID from a previously logged in user.
  * [x]  To prevent this, the other sites regenerate the session ID every 30 minutes, thus preventing illegal logins with an expired session ID.
   
## Green

### Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

[x] **S Username Enumeration** : A careless developer mistake has created a username enumeration vulnerability. Determine which color has the vulnerability. You can use the existing username "jmonroe99" as a test. Next, figure out what mistake the developer made.
 
Reading: [Username Enumeration](http://guides.codepath.com/websecurity/Username-Enumeration)

  * [x] GIF Walkthrough:  ![alt text](/green1.gif)

  * [x] As you can see from above, the Green Website has the Username Enumeration error where the failure to login message differs for the Username that exists vs doesn't exist.
  * [x] Using Chrome's debugging tool, we can see that the developer uses different classes for when the error exists due to non-existant username (class="failed"), which is not defined in the /green/public/styles.css, but for other errors, the developer uses class="failure" which is described in the given styles.css.
  * [x] The "failure" class is applied an bold style in css while "failed" class doesn't.

### Vulnerability #2: __________________

[x] **SQL Injection** : Most of the data input received by these websites is
  being sanitized properly. However, one of the three sites has one place where
  the input is not being sanitized before being used in an SQL query. Determine
  which color has the vulnerability.

  * [x] GIF Walkthrough:  ![alt text](/blue1.gif)

  * [x]  The Attacker injects the following sql command instead of the proper Salesperson's ID Number.
  ```html
  %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27
  ```
  * [x]  This causes the Database command to wait for 5 seconds while quering the data.
