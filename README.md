# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

### Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

[x] **SQL Injection** : Most of the data input received by these websites is
  being sanitized properly. However, one of the three sites has one place where
  the input is not being sanitized before being used in an SQL query. Determine
  which color has the vulnerability.

  * [x] GIF Walkthrough:  ![alt text](/blue1.gif)

  * [x]  The Attacker injects the following sql command instead of the proper Salesperson's ID Number.
  ```html
  %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27
  ```
  * [x]  This causes the Database command to wait for 5 seconds while quering the data.
